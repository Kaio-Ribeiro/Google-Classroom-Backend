In 1973, the seminal rock band Led Zeppelin, one of the founders of the music genre known as "heavy metal," went on tour and performed in Madison Square Garden. This documentary has concert footage, including the 23-minute-long version of the song "Dazed and Confused." The film also shows the musicians at home, pursuing some of their hobbies including drag-racing. The concert coverage also has scenes revealing what took place backstage, and a discussion of the theft of the band's cash during their visit to New York.



Blu Ray Extras
==============

Bonus Songs (1080p, 20 minutes) - Four extra tracks not included in the original film: "Over the Hills and Far Away," "Celebration Day," "Misty Mountain Hop" and "The Ocean." All of the songs offer Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround and Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo audio. 

Featurette: "The Robbery" (720p, 4 minutes) - This oddity is a vintage fake documentary on the $200M supposedly ripped off from the safe deposit box in the Drake Hotel that features in the film. I'm sure this is best understood after smoking lots of hash. 

TV Excerpt: "Boating Down the Thames: Robert Plant and Peter Grant" (720p, 8 minutes) - This excerpt from "The Old Grey Whistle Test" features Plant and Grant being interviewed as they float down the Thames on the Swanage Queen, talking about the the film, and the craziness of the tour it documents.

TV Report (720p, 3 minutes) - A brief 1973 TV report on Led Zeppelin's show at the Tampa Stadium. 

Cameron Crowe Radio Spotlight (720p, 14 minutes) - A short radio spot from 1976 hosted by a young Cameron Crowe.
